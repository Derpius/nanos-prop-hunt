Two teams with no team damage (ie we can use the built in team system)

More FPS-like controls and camera locked to first person for hunters, with no weapon controls and camera locked to third person for props

Method for spawning dynamic props automatically within a prop hunt map

Method for maps to register themselves with us for map switching, or alternatively we iterate over every map and look for a prefix like ph_


Gameloop:
Join server
if game in progress, spectate
else, add to waiting

after a game start timer, assign every player into hunters and props based on some parameters like:
	x ratio of hunters to props (configurable and only parameter to start with)
	recently played team

Hunters will have their screen blocked out, or alternatively placed in a waiting room on the map for a configurable amount of time
Props will be spawned as some easy to spot prop/model randomly at spawn points/areas

Configurable game timer will start, displayed at the top of the screen

Players can possess other props swapping their controll over to that prop (if not possible yet, just copy the target prop#s model over to us)
Players will be given more or less health depending on the size of the prop (standard health multiplied by the object's diameter as a percentage of a human's height)

Hunters will deal damage to themselves equal to what they would've dealt to props not possessed by players (with a VERY obvious warning AND a cooldown period before being able to fire again)

Parameters:
Percentage of players as hunters
Game length
Games before map swap

For maps to give:
Hunter spawn points
Prop player spawn points

Teams:
0: Spectator
1: Hunter
2: Prop

For now just pick a spawn point like sandbox does it
